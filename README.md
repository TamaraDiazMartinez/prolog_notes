# Prolog Notes

Some notes taken while working on Prolog (mostly SWI-Prolog)

## A Tradition

![Hiroshige: Shinagawa Station](pics/various/Hiroshige_Shinagawa_Station.jpg)

_From [The Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fifty-three_Stations_of_the_T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D) by Utagawa Hiroshige, 1832._

## The Logic Programming Landscape

![The Logic Programming Landscape](other_notes/quick_map_of_lp_landscape/quick_map_of_lp_landscape.svg)

So many *modeling languages* which are also *programming languages*, all a bit different.

Missed in the above: 

- [αProlog](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jcheney/programs/aprolog/) (Currently frozen?)
- [GOLOG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOLOG) (Ancient, based on Situation Calculus. What's the relationship to LPS?)
- [MProlog](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~nguyen/mpl.pdf) (PDF) for [Modal Logic](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/)
- NProlog: An extension of prolog with hypothetical implication. 
   - [part 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0743106684900293)
   - [part 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743106685800030)
- [HYPROLOG](http://akira.ruc.dk/~henning/hyprolog/) A Logic Programming Language with Abduction and Assumptions
- [GOAL Agent Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOAL_agent_programming_language)
- [LogicBlox](https://developer.logicblox.com/technology/)
- [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog)
- [Logical Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework)
- [Markov Logic Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_logic_network) -- This seems to be hot right now
- Lambda-Prolog: [A pragmatic reconstruction of Lambda-Prolog](https://hal-enac.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00934033)
- There should be something here on implementation of more general theorem provers using the very restricted top-down 
  theorem prover (or rather, "enumerating consequence checker") of Prolog. And how do you direct search in a theorem prover anyway?
  The NP desert is not for the faint of heart.

What is Prolog? In a 2012 paper by Peter Van Roy, [**Programming Paradigms for Dummies: What Every Programmer Should Know**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241111987_Programming_Paradigms_for_Dummies_What_Every_Programmer_Should_Know), the following diagram can be found on page 13:

## Journals

Lest I forget:

- [Theory and Practice of Logic Programming ](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/theory-and-practice-of-logic-programming) (Cambridge UP)
- [The Journal of Logic Programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/the-journal-of-logic-programming) (Elsevier)

- Having to do with general questions
   - [Some notes on the Logic](other_notes/about_the_logic/) (Prolog is said to be based on classical logic, but is this really true?)
   - [Some notes on the Truth Values](other_notes/about_truth_values) (Prolog is said to be based on two-valued logic, but is this really true, or advised?)
   - [Map of the Logic Programming landscape](other_notes/quick_map_of_lp_landscape) (actually quite detailed; shown above)
   - [Map of the Rule-based Systems landscape](other_notes/about_rule_based_systems) (first try)

Some predicates which may be of general use can be found in the [Code grabbag](code/)
