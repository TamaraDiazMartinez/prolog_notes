## Some additional documentation

Notes I took: 

[**About Dicts**](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_dicts/README.md)

## Do not forget to look at

   - [`library(dicts)`](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=dicts): Dict utilities
   - [Dict integration](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=ext-integration)

## Related implementations

The alternative (not using language built-ins) is `library(assoc)`. It creates maps by providing an AVL tree implementation (based on adequately structured terms, the same way as lists are based on adequately structured terms):

   - [`library(assoc)`](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=assoc)

If one looks at maps as records with named fields, a (maybe fallen into disuse?) alternative implementation is 

   - [`library(record)`](https://eu.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=record)

## Simple code to prettyprint a dict

If the values hold on one line...
