## Some potentially useful notes

[About `between∕3`](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_between/README.md)

## Extension of _between∕3_: _between∕4_ and _between∕5_, a (correctly lazy) "between" which also takes the "step"

   - [Code](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/between_with_step.pl) ([raw code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/between_with_step.pl))
   - [Unit tests](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/between_with_step.plt) ([raw code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/between_with_step.plt))
   - New to modules? [TL;DR for installation](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/TLDR_between_with_step.txt)

```
between(+Start,+End,+Step,?Value)
between(+Start,+End,+Step,?Value,?OptionList)
```

Example:

```
?- 
between(10,20,3,L).

L = 10 ;
L = 13 ;
L = 16 ;
L = 19.
```

Of course one could engineer something like

```
?- between(0,3,_X),L is 10+3*_X.
_X = 0,
L = 10 ;
_X = 1,
L = 13 ;
_X = 2,
L = 16 ;
_X = 3,
L = 19.
```

But why waste a good occasion to program and have all the checks in a nice predicate.

## Extension of _between∕3_: _between_x∕3_ which also generates acceptable intervals

```
between_x(?Low, ?High, ?Value)
```

Generate intervals around 0 by backtracking over `between_x(X,Y,0)` until at most 10 solutions have been obtained:

```
?- use_module(library('heavycarbon/utils/between_x.pl')).
true.

?- set_prolog_flag(answer_write_options,[max_depth(100)]).
true.

?- bagof([X,Y],limit(10,between_x(X,Y,0)),Bag).
Bag = [[0,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[-2,0],[-1,1],[0,2],[-3,0],[-2,1],[-1,2],[0,3]].
```

   - New to modules? [TL;DR for installation of the similarly named "between_with_step" predicate](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/code/heavycarbon/utils/TLDR_between_with_step.txt)

Unit tests are still missing. I really should add those.
