## Doc needs help

The example says: 

> the last two arguments [of foldl/4-7] form a typical difference pair

That's definitely not right. These values may not even be lists! They form the start and the end of a data-flowing "accumulator" chain though.

## Companion README 

A companion README with several examples (and an implementation of `foldr/4`) [**can be found here**](https://github.com/dtonhofer/prolog_notes/blob/master/swipl_notes/about_foldl/README.md)

## Super Simple Explainer

The key is: `foldl(Goal,[a,b,c,d],Starter,Final)` sets up a dataflow pipeline like this:

==
Starter -->--Goal-->--Goal-->--Goal-->--Goal-->--Final
              ^        ^        ^        ^
              |        |        |        | 
          [   a   ,    b   ,    c   ,    d  ]
==

And `Goal` is called with parameters whose name should be this:

==
Goal(Element,FromLeft,ToRight)                              for single list
Goal(Element1,Element2,FromLeft,ToRight)                    for two lists
Goal(Element1,Element2,Element3,FromLeft,ToRight)           for three lists
Goal(Element1,Element2,Element3,Element4,FromLeft,ToRight)  for four lists
==

... and that's all one really needs to know.
