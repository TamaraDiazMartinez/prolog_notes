This is not good (well, it it if you want to use random_member/2 to generate a stream of random booleans, but I think that's taking nondeterminism too far):

```
?- random_member(1,[1,2,3]).
false.

?- random_member(1,[1,2,3]).
true.
```

`random_member(1,[1,2,3])` should succeed because 1 is, if not a "random" member, then at least a member of `[1,2,3]`
