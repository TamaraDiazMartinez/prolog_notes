To use between_with_step.pl:

1) 

Set up a directory hierarchy with the Prolog module and the Prolog plunit code in your directory $FOO like this, wherever $FOO is:

$FOO
└── modules/
    └── heavycarbon/
        └── utils/
            ├── between_with_step.pl    <-- the source for between/4 and between/5 in module "between_with_step"
            └── between_with_step.plt   <-- the source for the plunit test "between_with_step" (which will be put into module "plunit_between_with_step")

2)             

Start SWI Prolog

Add the topmost directory to the library search path (replace $FOO as usual with an actual path):

?- assertz(file_search_path(library,'$FOO/heavycarbon')).

3) 

Load the module, which (confusingly) is given by file name, not module name:

?- use_module(library('heavycarbon/utils/between_with_step.pl')).

4) 

Load the associated .plt files automagically:

?- load_test_files([]).
true.

5)

Run tests

?- run_tests.
% PL-Unit: between_with_step ................................................................................ done
% All 80 tests passed
true.

6) 

Use between/4 and between/5 as usual.

(Sadly, help(between/4). and help(between/5). do not work yet).
