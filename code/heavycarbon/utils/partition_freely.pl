% Partition elements from "List" into an unspecified number of partitions.

% The "PartitionPred" is the predicate (or the closure) which yields the
% partition's "Key" for each "Element" of "List", being called like this:
%
% PartitionPred(Element,Key)
%
% The "PartitionDict" is the result, holding, at each "Key", the list of
% elements from "List" assigned to that "Key" by "PartitionPred". The "Tag"
% of the "PartitionDict" is unified with "Tag".

% - "How" indicates wheter we want the offensively coded or defensively
%   coded version.
% - "PartitioningPred" is the predicate that will be called to obtain the
%   partitoning key through a call to "PartitioningPred(Element,Key)".
% - "Element" is the current element from the input list that shall be assigned
%   to its partition.
% - "FromLeft" is a dict with keys the partitioning keys encountered up to now,
%   and values two-element lists "[Tip,Fin]" describing a nonempty open list:
%   "Tip" is the first listbox of a (nonempty) open list, and "Fin" is the cell
%   after the last listbox of that list, a "hole". The open list lists all the
%   values found to belong to the partition identified by "Key" so far.

% ---
% Called as foldl/4 goal: rebuild_in_foldl(How,Element,FromLeft,ToRight)
% ---
% - "How" indicates wheter we want the offensively coded or defensively
%   coded version.
% - "Element" is a pair "Key-Value" from the initially constructed dict.
%   Here, "Key" and "Value" have the meaning expected for a dict pair.
%   The "Value" is a 2-element list "[Tip,Fin]" where "Tip" is the first
%   listbox of a (nonempty) open list, and "Fin" is the cell after the last
%   listbox of that list, which, as this is an open list, is a "hole",
%   and not yet "[]".
%   The open list is transformed into a proper list by unifying "Fin" with [].
%   The resulting list is then added to a new dict that is handed rightwards.
% - FromLeft: The previous so-far-rebuilt dict containing only proper lists
%   as values.
% - ToRight: A new so-far-rebuilt dict containing only proper lists as values,
%   with the new entry for "Key".
