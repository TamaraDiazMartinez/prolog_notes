# Prolog jargon: terms, variables and all that

Prolog's terminology seems affected by too much history. 

There is unaccountable confusion between two domains, namely the syntactic domain (the 
one in evidence when we talk about source code) and the runtime domain (the one 
in evidence when we talk about what the running program is doing). One fluidly talks about
"terms" and "variables" in both domains, but the actual meaning of these words varies
between these domains, and by quite a bit.

Trying to clarify.
